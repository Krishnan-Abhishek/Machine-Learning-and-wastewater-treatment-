We have a wastewater sample which is contaminated by cefixime.The cefixime is degraded or broken down into products which are less harmful to environment.We are using a photocatalyst (Basically a substance which alters the rate of reaction and works only if it is exposed to light).The reaction being talked about is an oxidation reaction. 
Now using Artificial Networks, we need to model out the effects of the eight parameters on the photocatalytic efficiency (or how well the photocatalyst drives the degrdation reaction).These 8 parameters are the following:
1. Initial concentration of Cefixime
2. Intial pH of the reaction solution
3. UV and Visible radiation intensity
4. Photocatalyst Dosage
5. Concentration of Sodium hydrogen carbonate and Sodium Sulphate
